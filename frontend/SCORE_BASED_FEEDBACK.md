## üîÑ How It Works

### AI Prompt Customization

The prompt is dynamically generated based on score:

```typescript
if (focus_score >= 90) {
  messageGuidance = "CELEBRATE their achievement! Use enthusiastic language..."
} else if (focus_score >= 70) {
  messageGuidance = "Balanced feedback..."
} else {
  messageGuidance = "Constructive feedback with CONCRETE strategies..."
}
```

### Fallback Responses

Even when rate limited, fallback responses are score-aware:

**High Score (90+):**
```json
{
  "summary": "Outstanding performance! Exceptional focus score of 95%...",
  "strengths": [
    "Exceptional focus maintained",
    "Minimal distractions",
    "Strong self-control"
  ],
  "actionable_habits": [
    "Keep up your current routine!",
    "Share your techniques with others"
  ]
}
```

**Low Score (<70):**
```json
{
  "summary": "You completed the session with a 45% focus score. Staying focused can be challenging...",
  "strengths": [
    "You showed up and committed the time",
    "Determination despite challenges"
  ],
  "actionable_habits": [
    "Identify biggest distraction and remove it",
    "Use website blockers",
    "Start with shorter 15-20 min sessions",
    "Create dedicated study space"
  ]
}
```

## üé® Vibe Integration

The score-based feedback still respects the user's chosen vibe:

### Calm Vibe (90+ score)
> "You've cultivated exceptional focus. Your mindful approach to studying is paying off beautifully. Continue this peaceful, centered practice."

### Beast Vibe (90+ score)
> "CRUSHING IT! That 95% focus score proves you're a focus BEAST! Keep dominating your study sessions like this!"

### Gamified Vibe (90+ score)
> "üèÜ ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED: Focus Master! You scored 95% - that's legendary level! Your focus stats are off the charts!"

### Calm Vibe (<70 score)
> "Staying centered can be challenging with distractions. Let's gently explore ways to bring more mindfulness to your practice."

### Beast Vibe (<70 score)
> "You're facing some focus battles, but BEASTS don't quit! Let's strategize and DEMOLISH those distractions!"

### Gamified Vibe (<70 score)
> "Level Up Needed! Your focus XP is at 42%. Time to equip better gear (distraction blockers) and level up your concentration skill tree!"

## üîß Implementation Details

### Backend Changes
**File:** `src/api/server.ts`

**Key Logic:**
```typescript
// Determine message tone based on focus score
let scoreFeedback = '';
let messageGuidance = '';

if (focus_score >= 90) {
  scoreFeedback = 'EXCELLENT performance';
  messageGuidance = 'CELEBRATE! Use congratulatory language...';
} else if (focus_score >= 70) {
  scoreFeedback = 'GOOD performance with room for improvement';
  messageGuidance = 'Balanced feedback...';
} else {
  scoreFeedback = 'NEEDS IMPROVEMENT';
  messageGuidance = 'DON'T say "well done". Be honest but supportive...';
}
```

### AI Prompt Engineering
The prompt now includes:
- Score-specific guidance
- Critical rules based on performance level
- Example outputs for each tier
- Explicit instructions to avoid false praise
